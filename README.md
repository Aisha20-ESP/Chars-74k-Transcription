# Chars-74k-Transcription
Development of a Deep Learning model for transcription i.e. a model that can identify the character in the image.

*Dataset description The Chars74k dataset 

The dataset contains images of characters of the English language (Latin alphabet) divided into 62 classes (0-9, A-Z, a-z) as follows:

-7705 character images from real images (EnglishImg)                                                                                                                    
-3410 images of characters drawn on a tablet (EnglishHnd)                                                                                                                 
-62992 images of characters from fonts(EnglishFnt)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
That makes a total of 74K (hence the name of the dataset chars74K
